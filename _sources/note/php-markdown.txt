..  note:: 

    I do not use **PHP Markdown** anymore as of 01 October 2016 (Saturday)

#.  In case that you want to force Markdown-ed URL to be open in a new
    tab, please use the following JavaScript:

    ..  code-block:: html

        <script>$(document).ready(function(){

        $(document.links).filter(function () { return this.hostname !=
        window.location.hostname; }).attr('target', '\_blank');

        });</script>
        
#.  Anything inside p element will not be markdown-ed. Please make sure 
    that the p element is at its own line.
    
    ..  code-block:: html
        
        <p>
        **bold** and *italic* are not 
        working here.
        </p>
